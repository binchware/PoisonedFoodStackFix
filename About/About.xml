  <description>Fixes a well known (and arguably overblown) issue in the base game where the chance of food poisoning for a meal is distributed across all other meals in its stack, similar to how the base game handles hit points. For things like pemmican where you have large stacks and are eating multiple units at a time, this is actually a very efficient way to be handling things. For things like meals where you're only eating one unit at a time, however, it can be frustrating to realize that the game has no memory of how many poisoned units you've added to the stack and how many you've taken out. If you've ever gotten food poisoning from a meal that you could've sworn was a safe bet, this is likely the culprit.

The reason I say this is overblown is because - in the aggregate - you're still getting food poisoning about as often as you were supposed to. It only seems like a problem because you weren't noticing all the times this mechanic worked in your benefit. I suspect this is why Ludeon hasn't bothered to address it yet, although they probably should.

Fixing this is relatively simple - we update the game code to make the determination of whether or not a thing is poisoned at the time it's removed from the stack, rather than when it's ingested. That's all this mod actually does.

Note that there is a nearly identical mod in the workshop with many subscribers that, in my view, does not adequately address this issue. My main concerns are that (A) the mod does not allow you to safely disable it without jeopardizing the integrity of your save file, (B) the mod effectively reduces the risk of food poisoning from 4x meal bills by 75%, (C) the mod significantly reduces the risk of food poisoning for large-volume foods such as pemmican, and (D) these issues have presumably existed for years without anyone noticing. If you're having problems with other mods that claim to fix this issue, feel free to give my version a try - just make sure not to mix them.</description>
